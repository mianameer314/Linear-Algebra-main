## Definition of Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating them. It allows us to represent and solve problems using variables, equations, and functions. In the context of data science, algebra provides the necessary tools to:

- **Model Relationships**: Represent complex relationships between variables.
- **Solve Equations**: Determine unknown values in data problems.
- **Analyze Data**: Derive insights from datasets using algebraic techniques.

**Example**: If we have a dataset of house prices and sizes, algebra can help us create a model to predict house prices based on size using a linear equation.

## Types of Numbers

In pre-algebra, we encounter different types of numbers:

- **Natural Numbers**: Positive integers used for counting. 
  - Example: \(1, 2, 3,.................)
- **Whole Numbers**: Natural numbers including zero.
  - Example: \(0, 1, 2, 3, ..........)
- **Integers**: Whole numbers and their negative counterparts.
  - Example: \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .........)
- **Rational Numbers**: Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
  - Example:

- **Irrational Numbers**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
  - Example:

Understanding these numbers helps in performing accurate mathematical operations and analyzing data.

## Operations on Numbers

The fundamental operations in pre-algebra include:

- **Addition**: Combining two or more numbers.
  - Example: 3 + 4 = 7 
- **Subtraction**: Finding the difference between two numbers.
  - Example: 9 - 5 = 4
- **Multiplication**: Repeated addition of a number.
  - Example:

- **Division**: Splitting a number into equal parts.
  - Example:

**Order of Operations**: Use PEMDAS to solve expressions correctly:
- **Parentheses**: Perform operations inside parentheses first.
- **Exponents**: Calculate powers and roots.
- **Multiplication and Division**: From left to right.
- **Addition and Subtraction**: From left to right.

**Example**: For \(3 + 2 * 5) - 1\, first calculate inside the parentheses and multiplication:
2 * 5 = 10 
Then:
\[ 3 + 10 - 1 = 12 \]

## Key Terms in Algebra

Here are some key terms used in algebra:

- **Variable**: A symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown or changing value.
  - Example: In \(x + 2 = 5\), \(x\) is the variable.
- **Equation**: A statement that shows two expressions are equal.
  - Example: \(2x + 3 = 7\)
- **Inequality**: A statement showing one expression is greater than, less than, or not equal to another.
  - Example: \(x > 3\)
- **Function**: A relationship where one variable depends on the value of another.
  - Example: \(f(x) = 2x + 1\) describes a linear function where \(f(x)\) depends on \(x\).

## Fractions and Decimals

Fractions and decimals are essential for numerical representation and manipulation:

- **Fractions**: Represent a part of a whole as a ratio of two integers.
  - Example: 3 / 4 represents three parts of a whole divided into four equal parts.
- **Decimals**: Represent numbers using place value, separated by a decimal point.
  - Example: \(0.75\) is equivalent to 0.75/100 or 3/4.

**Operations with Fractions and Decimals**:
- **Addition/Subtraction**: Align decimal points or find a common denominator for fractions.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply numerators and denominators for fractions, or directly multiply decimals.
- **Division**: Divide fractions by multiplying by the reciprocal or perform long division for decimals.

**Example**: To add \(0.75\) and \(0.25\), align decimal points:
\[ 0.75 + 0.25 = 1.00 \]

## Ratios and Proportions

Understanding ratios and proportions is vital for analyzing relationships between quantities:

- **Ratios**: Compare two or more quantities. Written as a fraction or rate.
  - Example: The ratio of apples to oranges is \(3:2\), which can be written as 3/2.
- **Proportions**: Equations that show two ratios are equal.
  - Example: If a/b = c/d \), then \(a\) and \(d\) are in proportion with \(b\) and \(c\).

**Example**: If a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, and you want to use 6 cups of sugar, you need:

2/ 3 =x/ 6 

Cross-multiplying gives:

2 * 6  = 3 * 6

x = 4

So, you need 4 cups of flour.
