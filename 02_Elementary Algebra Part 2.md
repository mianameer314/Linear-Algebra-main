## Elementary Algebra for Data Science

### 4. Algebraic Functions and Plotting Through Graphs

Algebraic functions are the backbone of data analysis and modeling. These mathematical expressions, where variables are related to one another through operations, hold the key to unlocking insights hidden within your data.
#### Understanding Algebraic Functions:

- **Linear functions**: \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept
- **Quadratic functions**: \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are coefficients
- **Exponential functions**: \( y = a \cdot b^x \), where \( a \) is the initial value and \( b \) is the growth rate
- **Logarithmic functions**: 
  \( y = a \cdot \log_b(x) \), where \( a \) is the scale factor, and \( b \) is the base



#### Plotting Algebraic Functions:

- Graphing linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions on a coordinate plane
- Identifying key features of the graphs, such as intercepts, symmetry, and asymptotes
- Interpreting the graphical representations of functions to gain insights into data patterns and trends

#### Applying Algebraic Functions in Data Science:

- Modeling relationships between variables using appropriate function types
- Selecting the best-fit function to represent data and make predictions
- Leveraging function graphs to visualize and communicate data insights effectively

### 5. Applications and Methods to Solve Systems of Equations

Systems of equations, where multiple linear or nonlinear equations are solved simultaneously, are a powerful tool in data science. Mastering the techniques to tackle these systems can unlock a wealth of analytical possibilities.

#### Solving Linear Systems of Equations:

- Representing data-driven problems as systems of linear equations

#### Solving Nonlinear Systems of Equations:

- Extending the concept of systems to include nonlinear equations
- Employing numerical methods, such as Newton's method and iterative techniques, to find approximate solutions
- Recognizing the challenges and limitations of solving nonlinear systems, and strategizing appropriate approaches

#### Applications of Systems of Equations in Data Science:

- Modeling and optimizing complex systems, such as supply chains or resource allocation
- Solving for unknown variables in regression analysis and parameter estimation
- Investigating equilibrium states and decision-making scenarios in data-driven simulations
